    "section": "",
    "text": "Jakarta, one of the largest urban centers in Southeast Asia, faces severe traffic congestion due to rapid urban growth, high vehicle ownership, and an over-reliance on private transportation. While interventions like the odd-even license plate system and public transport expansion have been introduced, they have had limited success. Ride-hailing platforms offer an alternative means of transportation, yet the relationship between mobility patterns and congestion is still not fully understood.\nWith the availability of comprehensivenride-hailing data, which provides real-time movement patterns, we can study the demand for ride-hailing services around different points of interest (POIs) such as office complexes, shopping districts, recreational parks, and public amenities. This project aims to uncover how ride-hailing demand is distributed across the city and identify bottlenecks and high-demand zones to optimize urban mobility and support better traffic management strategies."

    "text": "2.1 Motivation\n\nThe increasing availability of ride-hailing data presents a unique opportunity to analyze real-time mobility trends and address urban traffic challenges. Understanding where people travel frequently and which POIs generate the most demand can guide more efficient urban planning and traffic management. Unlike traditional traffic studies, which focus mainly on road usage metrics, this project will adopt a user-centric approach by identifying ride-hailing hotspots around key locations.\nOur analysis will focus on the broader mobility landscape of Jakarta, examining how ride-hailing services are utilized across the city. The insights gained will support policymakers, urban planners, and transportation authorities in optimizing traffic management and public transport, with the potential to serve as a model for other urban areas."

Users will have access to filters that allow them to narrow data by date, time, vehicle type, and specific POIs. The visualizations will include heatmaps and choropleth maps to provide spatial insights, as well as desire line maps to track movement patterns between origins and destinations. Additionally, data tables will offer further breakdowns, enabling detailed analysis of rides segmented by POI, time, and vehicle type."

The central section will showcase interactive maps and visualizations that respond dynamically to the applied filters. A summary section at the bottom of the interface will display key statistics, such as the POIs with the highest demand and the most frequently traveled routes. This layout ensures that users can seamlessly explore traffic patterns and mobility behavior while interacting with the data.\n\n6.2.1 About the dataset\nThis section introduces users to the dataset used for the analysis, providing context on the data sources, columns, and key features. It includes a selection interface allowing users to filter specific columns and datasets, facilitating exploration and understanding of the available data.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 EDA\nThe EDA section allows users to explore and visualize ride-hailing demand trends through various charts. Users can analyze trip duration distributions with histograms, identify the most and least active points of interest (POIs) using bar charts, and monitor trends across different times of the day with line graphs. Filters by vehicle type, location points (origin/destination), and time of day provide further customization.\n\n\n\n6.2.3 ESDA\nThe ESDA section offers spatial insights into ride-hailing demand. Choropleth maps visualize demand across the city, while corresponding heatmaps highlight high-activity areas. Users can adjust the time range using an interactive slider to view traffic patterns during specific hours, and filters allow exploration by vehicle type and location point, segmented by weekday or weekend activity.\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Flow Data Analysis\nThis section focuses on analyzing movement patterns between POIs using desire line maps. It visualizes frequently traveled routes and helps identify traffic flow patterns across peak times (morning, afternoon, evening, night). Users can switch between car and motorcycle data to compare travel behavior and assess which routes experience the highest demand."
