# **1.0 Background**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/clipboard-2612382224.png)

Jakarta, one of the largest urban centers in Southeast Asia, faces severe traffic congestion due to rapid urban growth, high vehicle ownership, and an over-reliance on private transportation. While interventions like the odd-even license plate system and public transport expansion have been introduced, they have had limited success. Ride-hailing platforms offer an alternative means of transportation, yet the relationship between **mobility patterns and congestion** is still not fully understood.

With the availability of comprehensivenride-hailing data, which provides real-time movement patterns, we can study the **demand for ride-hailing services** around different **points of interest (POIs)** such as office complexes, shopping districts, recreational parks, and public amenities. This project aims to uncover how ride-hailing demand is distributed across the city and identify **bottlenecks and high-demand zones** to optimize urban mobility and support better traffic management strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **2.0 Problem Statement**

![](images/clipboard-3096906590.png){width="668"}

Jakarta’s rapid urbanization has amplified the need for on-demand transportation services like ride-hailing, particularly in districts with a high concentration of points of interest (POIs). However, there is a limited understanding of how these districts influence traffic congestion across the city. Key questions include:

-   Which districts generate the highest ride-hailing traffic for origins and destinations?

-   What factors contribute to the high demand in these districts?

-   How does ride-hailing demand fluctuate across different times of the day, week, and seasons?

-   Can ride-hailing services enhance access to key locations while mitigating traffic congestion?

Addressing these questions will shed light on Jakarta’s mobility patterns and guide strategies to minimize traffic bottlenecks while maintaining efficient access to critical areas.

## **2.1 Motivation**

![](images/ride-hailing.jpg)

The increasing availability of **ride-hailing data** presents a unique opportunity to analyze real-time mobility trends and address urban traffic challenges. Understanding where people travel frequently and **which POIs generate the most demand** can guide more efficient urban planning and traffic management. Unlike traditional traffic studies, which focus mainly on road usage metrics, this project will adopt a **user-centric approach** by identifying **ride-hailing hotspots** around key locations.

Our analysis will focus on the broader mobility landscape of Jakarta, examining how ride-hailing services are utilized across the city. The insights gained will support **policymakers, urban planners, and transportation authorities** in optimizing traffic management and public transport, with the potential to **serve as a model for other urban areas**.

## **2.2 Project Objectives**

**This project aims to:**

1.  Analyze ride-hailing demand across Jakarta at both district and township levels to identify traffic bottlenecks.

2.  Enable users to explore and interact with the dataset, facilitating the evaluation of demand fluctuations over time and the identification of spatial and temporal trends.

3.  Investigate clustering patterns in trip demand, including where trips originate and end. Identify demand hotspots and examine the factors driving these patterns.

# **4.0 Expected Outcomes**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to deliver a comprehensive, data-driven dashboard that provides actionable insights into Jakarta’s mobility network using an extensive ride-hailing dataset. The dashboard will serve as an interactive platform for users to explore traffic patterns, demand trends, and mobility flows at district and township levels across the city. By leveraging advanced visualizations and analytical tools, Jakarta officials, urban planners, and researchers can gain deeper insights into traffic bottlenecks, demand fluctuations, and clustering patterns of trips.

The primary objective is to create an intuitive analytical interface that empowers users to conduct their own analyses and interpret trends based on real-time and historical data. Rather than offering prescriptive recommendations, the dashboard acts as a reference point for answering key questions such as:

-   **Which districts generate the highest ride-hailing demand for origins and destinations?**

-   **What factors drive high demand in these districts, and how does demand fluctuate over different times of the day, week?**

-   **Where are the primary traffic bottlenecks forming, and how do they evolve over time?**

-   **Are there clustering patterns in demand for trips, and what are the factors influencing these hotspots?**

Through tools such as heatmaps, clustering visualizations, demand trend graphs, and interactive flow maps, users can explore spatial and temporal trends, experiment with the data, and evaluate what-if scenarios. The dashboard provides a rich dataset and flexible interface, fostering exploration and enabling stakeholders to draw their own conclusions about Jakarta’s traffic system and mobility patterns.

# **5.0 Scope Of Analysis**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The proposed methodology employs a series of analytical techniques to uncover spatial and temporal patterns in Jakarta’s ride-hailing demand. Each step builds on the previous, creating a layered understanding of mobility dynamics.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA provides an initial overview of demand patterns, identifying key districts with the highest activity for origins and destinations through bar charts. Charts to help compare trip durations across vehicle types like cars and motorcycles, while line graphs reveal temporal trends by segmenting demand into morning, afternoon, evening, and night. This sets the foundation for deeper spatial analysis.

**Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Network KDE (NKDE):** KDE maps demand hotspots, showing areas with the highest concentrations of ride-hailing activity. NKDE refines this by aligning hotspots with the road network, offering actionable insights into demand clustering along key transportation corridors, critical for addressing congestion and improving route efficiency.

**Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA): L**ISA highlights clusters and outliers in demand, uncovering localized factors such as commercial hubs or underutilized areas. It adds a granular understanding of demand distribution that complements broader density analyses.

**Origin-Destination (OD) Analysis:** OD analysis ties everything together by mapping the flow of trips between districts. It reveals key mobility patterns, identifies bottlenecks, and provides a holistic view of how ride-hailing demand shifts across the city.

**How It Comes Together:** EDA sets the stage with key trends, KDE and NKDE identify spatial hotspots, LISA adds localized insights, and OD analysis connects these patterns to broader flows. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive framework for understanding Jakarta’s ride-hailing demand and informing strategies to address traffic congestion and improve mobility.
