# **1.0 Background**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/clipboard-2612382224.png)

Jakarta, one of the largest urban centers in Southeast Asia, faces severe traffic congestion due to rapid urban growth, high vehicle ownership, and an over-reliance on private transportation. While interventions like the odd-even license plate system and public transport expansion have been introduced, they have had limited success. Ride-hailing platforms like **Grab** offer an alternative means of transportation, yet the relationship between **mobility patterns and congestion** is still not fully understood.

With the availability of **Grab Posisi data**, which provides real-time movement patterns, we can study the **demand for ride-hailing services** around different **points of interest (POIs)** such as office complexes, shopping districts, recreational parks, and public amenities. This project aims to uncover how ride-hailing demand is distributed across the city and identify **bottlenecks and high-demand zones** to optimize urban mobility and support better traffic management strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **2.0 Problem Statement**

![](images/clipboard-3096906590.png){width="668"}

Jakarta’s increasing urbanization drives a growing need for **on-demand transportation services** like Grab, particularly in areas with high concentrations of **POIs**. However, there is limited understanding of how these points influence traffic congestion across the city. Key questions include:

-   Which POIs generate the most ride-hailing traffic?

-   How does demand vary across different times of the day, week, and seasons?

-   Can ride-hailing services improve access to key locations while alleviating congestion?

Answering these questions will provide insights into **Jakarta’s mobility patterns** and inform strategies to **reduce traffic bottlenecks** while maintaining access to key locations.

## **2.1 Motivation**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/clipboard-338652397.png)

The increasing availability of **ride-hailing data** presents a unique opportunity to analyze real-time mobility trends and address urban traffic challenges. Understanding where people travel frequently and **which POIs generate the most demand** can guide more efficient urban planning and traffic management. Unlike traditional traffic studies, which focus mainly on road usage metrics, this project will adopt a **user-centric approach** by identifying **ride-hailing hotspots** around key locations.

Our analysis will focus on the broader mobility landscape of Jakarta, examining how Grab services are utilized across the city. The insights gained will support **policymakers, urban planners, and transportation authorities** in optimizing traffic management and public transport, with the potential to **serve as a model for other urban areas**.

## **2.2 Project Objectives**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Analyze ride-hailing demand** across Jakarta to identify patterns at key POIs and traffic bottlenecks.

2.  **Investigate spatial and temporal trends** in Grab usage to understand how ride demand fluctuates.

3.  **Provide recommendations** for traffic management based on the analysis of high-demand areas and movement flows.

4.  **Optimize mobility services** by suggesting improvements to ride-hailing operations.

5.  **Develop a scalable framework** that other cities can use to address similar urban mobility challenges.

# **4.0 Expected Outcomes**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to **offer a comprehensive data-driven dashboard** that provides insights into Jakarta’s traffic network based on Grab Posisi data. The dashboard will serve as a **platform for exploration and learning**, enabling users to interact with various traffic patterns, demand trends, and mobility flows across the city. Using **interactive visualizations and analysis tools**, Jakarta officials, planners, and researchers can gain a deeper understanding of traffic conditions and mobility behavior in different parts of the city.

The primary objective is to **provide a rich dataset and analytical interface**, allowing users to **conduct their own analyses** and **interpret trends** based on real-time and historical data. The dashboard does not offer prescriptive recommendations but acts as a **data point reference** where users can explore key questions such as:

-   Which points of interest (POIs) generate the highest ride-hailing traffic?

-   How does ride-hailing demand fluctuate across different times of the day or seasons?

-   Where are the primary traffic bottlenecks forming, and how do they shift over time?

This project will provide an opportunity for **users to draw their own conclusions** about Jakarta’s traffic system and mobility patterns. By offering access to detailed data visualizations—such as **heatmaps, demand clusters, and desire line maps**—the dashboard empowers users to **experiment with the data** and explore **what-if scenarios** without enforcing specific solutions.

For **Jakarta officials and transportation planners**, the dashboard will act as a **decision-support tool**, enhancing their ability to analyze mobility trends and traffic dynamics with real-time data. It will encourage **exploration and deeper inquiry** into traffic behavior rather than prescribe rigid policies or recommendations. This approach ensures that **multiple stakeholders** can use the insights to make data-informed decisions based on their unique contexts and priorities.

# 5.0 Proposed Scope

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The proposed methodology involves a combination of

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** will include both aspatial and temporal insights. Bar charts will reveal the top five points of interest (POIs) generating the highest demand for ride-hailing services. Histograms will compare trip durations across different vehicle types, such as cars and motorcycles, while line graphs will track demand trends throughout the day, segmented into morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

2.  **Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)**, choropleth maps will visualize the distribution of ride-hailing demand across Jakarta, offering a city-wide overview of activity levels. Heatmaps will highlight high-demand zones or hotspots, while point pattern analysis using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) will help identify areas where demand clusters are most prominent.

3.  **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**, will further deepen the analysis by examining how demographic factors, proximity to POIs, and traffic conditions influence ride-hailing demand within different neighborhoods. This regression technique will detect spatial variations in the significance of these factors, revealing how demand shifts across various areas of the city.

4.  **Traffic Flow Analysis**, desire line maps will be used to visualize movement patterns between key POIs, providing insights into frequently traveled routes. This analysis will also help identify bottlenecks, optimal travel routes, and how different POIs influence commuting behavior during different times of the day.

5.  **Forecasting and Optimization** will apply advanced time series models such as **ARIMA** and **LSTM** to predict future demand patterns. These forecasts will inform vehicle allocation strategies, aimed at minimizing wait times for passengers and reducing congestion across high-demand areas.
